## â‚¬ Sheneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

# 2.3

- A one-way function is a function that is fairly easy to compute, but very hard to reverse. It's a very important part of public-key cryptography.
- A trapdoor one-way function is a special type of one-way function that can be reversed with a secret "trapdoor". This means some secret information. PGP uses this for its pub-key encryption and digital signatures.
- Trapdoor functions are used in public-key cryptography for encryption and decryption.

# 2.4 

- A one-way hash function takes a message, for example a file and turns it into a short string of numbers. These numbers are called a hash.
- It's easy to compute a hash, but it's hard to find the original message in the hash.
- A good hash function is collision-free, which basically means it's impossible to find two different messages, with the same hash.

I managed to crack the hash! it's "disobey"!
