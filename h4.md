### Broken access rights

- Broken access tools refers to enforcing a policy where users are not able to act 
  outside of the permissions given to the users an attack scenario could be forcing
  the target system to enter two websites of which another needs admin rights.
  If the attacker can access both sites, there is a flaw that the attacker can exploit

- Prevention is done by containing access control in trusted server-side code and server-less API.
  Limiting access control to only relevant systems and minimizing shared resources.
  
Question

Can the attacker move laterally and gain access to whole network if admin rights are gained on one system?

### Security misconfiguration

- Security misconfigurations refer to security weaknesses that are created by flawed development.
  For example misconfigured permissions, outdated security, default passwords, server traffic not secured.
  These flaws make an application an easy target for attacks.
- This goes to show that a security hardening process, documentation, continuous security checks and
  containerization is a key part of developmental process.
- An example attack could be that the Cloud service provider has misconfigured sharing rights that
  can be accessed by other users.

Comment

Always double check! Can never be too careful!

### Vulnerable and Outdated Components

- Vulnerable and outdated components refers to soft- and hardware that is vulnerable or too old.
  This could mean for example that your software or hardware has certain known security flaws that are difficult to
  patch due to being outdated or unsupported. You should always be aware of what you are working with
  so there are no ugly surprises!
- Preventing is done by regular check ups on soft- and hardware updates, removing things you don't use or understand,
  obtaining soft- and hardware through official sources

Question

Has there been instances of infected/vulnerable soft- or hardware reaching a big company when buying new stuff?

### Injection

- Injection refers to an attacker injecting input that could be mistakenly treated as code or commands.
  This means the attacker finds a way to inject malicious inputs that are then executed by the target, potentially
  giving the attacker the ability to read or write data and run code.
- Prevention is done by using safe API's that avoid interpreting recieved input altogether.

Question

Is it possible for an attacker to use my web traffic as an injection vessel? Would I be implicated?

### Munroe

I think this comic refers to SQL injection, where the kid is named Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--? that
would remove all student tables. I liked that the mom told them to sanitize their data inputs, refering to
hardening their injection security.

### :( I had a lot of trouble installing WebGoat and in the end didn't succeed. <img width="887" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1d070f1-2c8a-4626-8dd5-c2569a39a567" />


### I didn't really understand the PortSwigger exercise. I understand that you can inject a modification of the category filter, but I don't understand how it would work in practice.

### SQL ZOO
SELECT 0.1 Here we can find populations of different countries. I Input Germany in the where and it shows me the population!

SELECT 0.3 Here we change the values inbetween so the countries inside the values show.

SELECT 1.1 Here we see that the columns are already in place!

SELECT 1.2: Here we had to switch the count to 2 million and make it greater than or the same.
