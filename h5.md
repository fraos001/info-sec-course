### â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C, is a book
  written by Bruce Schneier which goes deeper into what is Cryptography in itself.
  It talks about it's foundations, protocols, techniques, real-world use cases and
  the source code that it's built on.
- According to the book, Cryptography is the art and science behind keeping
  messages secure. Cryptography has been used since the Roman times to avoid
  possible eavesdropping on secure messaging channels. Today digital messaging channels
  need encryption and decryption, which are mathematical algorithms designed by cryptographers. These
  algorithms are called Ciphers.
- Today, secure messaging channels are based on sending plaintext, which is converted
  into ciphertext via encryption, then it's turned back to the original plaintext to be read
  by the reciever, via decryption. This image shows the process in effect.

### Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg

- This article is written by Tero Karvinen, our teacher and it talks about how to send
  secret messages over untrusted internet via PGP. Which is a encryption protocol widely used today
  in secure messaging channels. This article shows how to set up "gpg", which is a Linux based
  GNU privacy guard to encrypt your messages.

### Installing OpenSSH server and connecting to it using "ssh" client

A "self-hosted" password manager is needed to keep your passwords secure, contained and encrypted. This way
you don't depend on 3rd party cloud-based managers that could be breached and leaked on the internet!

### Pretty Good indeed
