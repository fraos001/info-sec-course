### Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

In this article Cooper Quintin talks about things everybody should know about TOR. 

- The first thing he mentions is that TOR still provides anonymity to it's users by giving the example that even the USA's NSA could not completely crack the encryption. They have however found exploits that are caused by misconfigured TOR connections and bugs in the used browsers.

- Secondly he mentions that TOR is not only used by criminals and pedophiles, but by all kinds of people that need to preserve their identity and privacy while using the internet. Some of these include journalists, activists, he even lists families! He also includes militaries, who are the ones that created TOR in the first place!

- His third point is that even though TOR was created by the military, it doesn't give them access to a backdoor. This is all demonstrated in the fact that TOR is open source, so anybody can check the code and see that there isn't anything fishy!

- His fourth point is that providing TOR relays is not illegal, atleast in the US. This doesn't save you from potentially being asked questions about your activities, especially if you run an exit relay. 

- His fifth point is that TOR is easy to use and that there is this idea that privacy-prioritizing software is somehow inherently hard to use or complicated to configure. Quintin gives the examples of Tor Browser Bundle and TailsOS for easy TOR use.

- His sixth point is that there is a misconception that TOR browsing is very slow. He says that TOR devs have been working hard to make it faster, and that it's now the fastest it's ever been!

- His seventh point concludes the article well. He says that TOR is not foolproof. You can always compromise your anonymity if you use TOR incorrectly. He says that it is always important to use up-to-date software and to avoid logging into clearnet services like Google or Facebook while using TOR.


### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser â‚¬; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR"

In the introduction to the book, Shavers and Bair say that with this book they aim to help the reader understand and investigate covert communication in our day of technology. The goal of the book is to give insight into how these methods of communication work and how investigators can uncover them.

# History and Intended Use of The Onion Router

- TOR is short for The Onion Router, which was originally developed by the US Navy and made to enable anonymous communication over the Internet.
- It was made to protect user privacy by encrypting traffic that would lead back to the user.
- It is not intended for criminal use, but rather for anonymous communication for individuals that don't for whatever reason what people nosing around their activities.

# How The Onion Router Works

- Tor uses volunteerly operated servers, known as relays, fron which the TOR internet traffic is routed through.
- Every relay encrypts the flowing data, which adds layers of encryption. This makes up the metaphor of the "Onion" which has many layers.
- This method of layered encryption makes it nearly impossible to trace traffic to it's original user.

# Tracking Criminals Using TOR:

- Even though Tor is effective at making traffic anonymous, investigators still may uncover crumbs left by the trail of the user.
- These investigators can combine TOR with other tools and methods to further look into the user.
- Hidden services, like .onion websites can be used by criminals, which require specialized techniques to investigate.

Was surprised to see that the leading TOR search engine has a picture of the Hakaniemi metro and a finnish name in the URL!

Here's a finnish forum called "Anonyymi keskustelupaikka"!

Here's a finnish marketplace for illicit drug vendors! They use dead drops and the postal service to deliver. Payment is done apparently in XMR, which is a cryptocurrency. Interesting!

This is ProPublica! It's a very good invastigative journalism organization based in New York City!
