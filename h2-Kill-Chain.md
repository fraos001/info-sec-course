# h2 Kill Chain
## x)

The term 'kill chain' refers to a progress, in which an entity tries to target and engage an adversary to sabotage or have an effect on the adversarys resources.

It consists of seven steps; Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control and finally, Actions on Objectives.

### Reconnaissance 
Reconnaissance refers to the first process in the kill chain, where the attacking entity tries to research, identify and select targets to find possible vulnerabilities and ways to start the attack.
### Weaponization
Weaponization refers to the second process in the kill chain, where the attacking entity begins the attack by fabricating hidden weaponized software (Trojans) and attempting to breach the targeted systems with exploits to deliver the payload.
### Delivery
Once weaponization is tested and ways to attack targets are found, the attacking entity tries to deliver the payload. This is usually done by E-mail attachments, USBs or malicious websites.
### Exploitation 
When the payload is delivered, it has to excecute. If excecuted, the attacking entity usually begins to earn remote access to excecute code and find new vulnerabilities.
### Installation
The attacking entity starts to excecute code and move laterally inside systems to establish control.
### Command and Control (C2)
To gain complete access to the compromised system, the attacking entities must create backdoor channels to access and gain total control of the victim system.
### Actions on Objectives
Once the attacking identity has gained hands-on access to the victim system. They can start to complete their objectives. Usually these involve the encryption, extraction and collection of the victims information or possibly move laterally inside the victim system.

## a)

### Tactic
Tactics refer to the 'why' of the attacking entities tactical goal. (For example Lateral movement)
### Technique and Sub-technique
The techniques and Sub-techniques refer to the 'how' a attacking entity gains access to excecute it's goals. (For example Adversary-in-the-Middle by a way of DHCP Spoofing)
### Procedure
Procedure refers to the implementation of the Tehniques and the Sub-techniques of the adversary to attack the victim system. (For example Traffic redirection)
