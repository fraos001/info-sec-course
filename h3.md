# H3

x) We did this exercise in class. I downloaded and installed the Oracle Virtualbox, downloaded the ISO file and booted
a Debian VM. I finished setting up the VM using the steps provided in the guide.

I also tried out some of the basic Linux commands provided in the second guide provided!

a-b) First I killed my network connection, then I pinged both the Cloudfare DNS server and the Google DNS server. The pings came back as "ping: connect: Network is unreachable".

I started my localhost portscanning by installing the nmap with sudo apt-get install nmap. Then I used the command nmap localhost to scan for open ports. I found for example the ports 22 (SSH) and port tcp 631 (IPP) open. 

c) Next I installed Apache2 daemon, which opened port 80 for HTTP traffic, reducing closed ports from 999 to 998. This created a potential security entry point for attackers. Later disabled the daemon and reconnected to network.

d) I started by connecting to the Bandit servers using the SSH command (ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthwire.org -p 2220)
In level 0 I used the ls command to see a list of files in the current directory. After that I used the cat command to open the file 'readme'.

In level 1 I used the cd command to see the file path to the '-' file in the current directory and opened the file using the cat command and the file path.

In level 2 I used the cat command with ./ and inside the path I put the filename inside quotations.

In level 3 I changed the working directory with the cd command into the inhere directory, after that I used the find command to find files inside the directory.
Then to access the file I used the cat command to open using the path I found with the find command.

In level 4 I changed the working directory using the cd command into the inhere directory. After that I manually opened each file inside the directory until I found the human readable one.
