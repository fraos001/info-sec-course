Baiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto
- Threat modeling should be actively evolving, integrated and practiced in a organizations OpSec practices
- Threat modeling should be done together with good communication between different branches of IT in an organization
- Use different automation tools to streamline threat modeling

Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course
- Four questions in threat modeling
   - What are we working on?
   - What could go wrong?
   - What could be done about it?
   - Are we happy with the finished product?
- Create a diagram of data flow and find potential threats in the diagram
- Address the different threat potentials, document them and come up with a possible solution


OWASP CheatSheets Series (2021): Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet
- No universal standard for Threat Modeling, but recommended to start at design phase and divide into four steps:
   - System modeling
   - Threat Identification
   - Response and mitigations
   - Review and validation
- These steps should be regurarly reviewed and updated to fit into the systems frames

a) 
Everyone should understand and follow basic OpSec practices. Keep passwords safe, either in a encrypted password manager or on a physical sheet. 
Dont download anything you are unsure about or atleast research what you are downloading and where from.
Keep yourself at least loosely up to date with new methods and strategies used by threat actors.

b) 
Healthy ABB works with indexing patient health records into a national wellness database.
  
**What are we working on?**
Healthy ABB works with hospitals and health services in gathering patient data and safely indexing it into a national database. Company needs to make sure users of service and workers understand and follow OpSec.
Users and workers need to understand different threat vectors (Social Engineering, Web-based, Network-based, Physical etc.) Our company is in charge of very important data and safe handling practices should be used to handle data.

**What can go wrong**
Different attack strategies could be used to attack database, users or workers.
A social engineering and physical attack could for example involve a threat actor impersonating a worker and infiltrating customer systems (hospitals, pharmacies etc.)
A web-based attack could involve phishing attempts sent to workers or users via email. A network-based attack could be done with the access gained by the other threat vectors and would give access to threat actors into patient database.

**What are we going to do about it?** 
Workers and users should be informed about threat vectors and updated constantly on currently revelant Threat modeling. Safest possible measures should be taken to protect key data.

**Did we do a good enough job?** 
The organization should constantly re-evaluate threat modeling and should be as up to date as possible with current threat vectors and new ways threat actors could try attacking.
